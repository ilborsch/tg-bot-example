# tg-bot-example
A sample Telegram Bot application built in Go. I experimented with various architectural and programming patterns to explore different approaches. After all, improvisation is a key part of learning, right? Even if it's bad solution...

I apologise but this GitHub repository will not have a proper README.md file. 
If really want to take a look on my repos and hire me please see other repos like https://github.com/ilborsch/go-grpc-auth (this one is very good)
