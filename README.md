# tg-bot-example
A sample Telegram Bot application built in Go. I experimented with various architectural and programming patterns to explore different approaches. After all, improvisation is a key part of learning, right? Even if it's bad solution...

Yes, I know that I pushed config with the real Telegram token...
This Telegram bot wa initially planned to be one of the products of Bot Factory company, but things didn't go as intended, therefore the applications was not released and I was allowed to publish it!!!

I apologise but this GitHub repository will not have a proper README.md file. 
If really want to take a look on my repos and hire me please see other repos like https://github.com/ilborsch/go-grpc-auth (this one is very good)
